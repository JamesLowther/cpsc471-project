## Winter 2021

***
### Overview
Contains source code for the CPSC 471 term project. The project consists of two parts, a front end and a back end API.

The *Remote Patient - Doctor Symptom Analyser* is an all-in-one web service and database that allows patients to submit the required bureaucratic forms before a consultation by a doctor, and allows the doctor to perform the diagnosis remotely based on an extensive history submitted by the patient. The doctor can search the database for medications, illnesses and symptoms and perform a remote diagnosis, taking into account the unique history and complaint of each individual.

This tool serves as a proof-of-concept that the dangers of transmission from in-person consultations and the tedious filling of forms required for an accurate diagnosis can be avoided. Patient confidentiality is maintained through authentication and strict access to only certain users assigned to each patient. Admittance and diagnosis is streamlined with the use of a central database that tracks extensive medical data of each patient as well as a large set of illnesses, medications and symptoms that is expandable and available to all medical personnel using the tool.

The design of the *Remote Patient - Doctor Symptom Analyser* consists of three different end users with varying access levels to data: Patients, Doctors, and Clerks. The users have access to submit and edit various forms and sections of forms relevant to their role. Furthermore, Clerks and Doctors have access to edit the database of illnesses, medications and the relevant symptoms and side effects. These illnesses and medications are used in reference with various forms to perform accurate diagnosisâ€™ and simplified completion of forms.
